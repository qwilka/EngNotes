It is an online “book” format, that can be hosted directly from a GitHub repository. You are currently reading a GitBook designed to help you get started creating your own educational GitBooks for your courses (how meta!). It does this in two ways: By explaining how to create GitBooks, and by serving as a template that you can copy and edit, instead of having to start from scratch. This template GitBook has all the settings that I consider to be useful for educational GitBooks, but you can always customize it. I will focus specifically on GitBooks that are made in Rstudio, using the rmarkdown markup language, rendered using the bookdown package, and hosted on GitHub. If you want to get started, skip ahead to Chapter 2; if you need more convincing, keep reading below. 1.1 My Engineering Notes To note engineering This are miscellaneous engineering notes that I have made over the years.
